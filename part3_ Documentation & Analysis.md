. Implementation Process
Challenges Encountered:

The ASVspoof dataset is large and requires significant storage space. Due to limited storage availability in the working environment (Google Colab), I was unable to use the complete dataset.

Preprocessing and ensuring the correct audio format and sample rate for model compatibility caused some initial issues.

The original RawNet2 model was designed for full training; adapting it for light fine-tuning required freezing most layers and only updating the classification head.

Conv1D input shape mismatches and audio padding/truncation were also tricky to resolve.

How Challenges Were Addressed:

To manage storage constraints, I selected a small subset of the data (85 bonafide and 85 spoofed samples) for training and validation.

I preprocessed audio to have a consistent shape using zero-padding and resampling to the expected 16kHz sample rate.

I froze all layers except the final fully connected layer for light fine-tuning to reduce training time and resource usage.

A custom collate function was used to batch variable-length audio clips.

Assumptions Made:

The pretrained RawNet2 model captures generalized audio features applicable to spoof detection tasks.

Fine-tuning only the final classification layer is sufficient to adapt the model for a small subset of ASVspoof data.

2. Analysis
Model Selected: RawNet2

Reason for Selection:

RawNet2 is a state-of-the-art model specifically designed for speaker verification and spoof detection.

It operates directly on raw audio, reducing reliance on handcrafted features like spectrograms.

It is lightweight and feasible to adapt for limited-resource environments.

Model Overview:

RawNet2 uses a stack of residual convolutional blocks on raw audio input.

It extracts deep hierarchical features, followed by gated recurrent units (GRUs) and a fully connected layer for classification.

It is trained using BCEWithLogitsLoss for binary classification (bonafide vs spoof).

Performance on Subset Dataset:

Due to the small training dataset (170 samples total), performance metrics are not representative of full model capacity.

Initial results after two epochs:

Epoch 1: Loss = 23.85, Accuracy = 44.85%

Epoch 2: Loss = 23.58, Accuracy = 50.00%

Accuracy is around random chance; however, model shows small signs of learning.

Strengths:

RawNet2 handles raw waveform input, eliminating the need for manual feature extraction.

Performs well on large-scale spoof detection benchmarks.

Weaknesses (in this setup):

Requires large amounts of training data for optimal performance.

Fine-tuning on limited data leads to slow or ineffective learning.

Pretrained weights may not generalize perfectly across different spoof types.

Suggestions for Future Improvements:

Use more of the ASVspoof dataset to allow better fine-tuning.

Explore data augmentation techniques to increase dataset diversity.

Gradually unfreeze additional layers of the model for deeper adaptation.

Evaluate with different spoof detection models (e.g., Wav2Vec2, LCNN) for comparison.

3. Reflection
1. Most Significant Challenges:

Working with large datasets on limited cloud storage and compute.

Adapting a full model like RawNet2 to perform well on small-scale fine-tuning.

2. Real-World vs. Research Performance:

In research, models are trained on large curated datasets. In the real world, spoof patterns may vary and generalization becomes harder.

Performance may degrade if real-world spoofing techniques are not represented in the training set.

3. Improving Performance:

Increase dataset size, or use synthetic data generation.

Implement audio augmentation (e.g., noise injection, pitch shifting).

Leverage more powerful compute resources to unfreeze more of the model.

4. Deployment Considerations:

Convert model to ONNX or TorchScript for optimized inference.

Integrate into a streaming audio pipeline with real-time processing.

Add fallback or confidence thresholds to reduce false positives/negatives.
